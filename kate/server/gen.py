"""``tornado.gen`` implements generator-based coroutines.

.. note::

   The "decorator and generator" approach in this module is a
   precursor to native coroutines (using ``async def`` and ``await``)
   which were introduced in Python 3.5. Applications that do not
   require compatibility with older versions of Python should use
   native coroutines instead. Some parts of this module are still
   useful with native coroutines, notably `multi`, `sleep`,
   `WaitIterator`, and `with_timeout`. Some of these functions have
   counterparts in the `asyncio` module which may be used as well,
   although the two may not necessarily be 100% compatible.

Coroutines provide an easier way to work in an asynchronous
environment than chaining callbacks. Code using coroutines is
technically asynchronous, but it is written as a single generator
instead of a collection of separate functions.

For example, here's a coroutine-based handler:

.. testcode::

    class GenAsyncHandler(RequestHandler):
        @gen.coroutine
        def get(self):
            http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
            response = yield http_client.fetch("http://example.com")
            do_something_with_response(response)
            self.render("template.html")

Asynchronous functions in Tornado return an ``Awaitable`` or `.Future`;
yielding this object returns its result.

You can also yield a list or dict of other yieldable objects, which
will be started at the same time and run in parallel; a list or dict
of results will be returned when they are all finished:

.. testcode::

    @gen.coroutine
    def get(self):
        http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
        response1, response2 = yield [http_client.fetch(url1),
                                      http_client.fetch(url2)]
        response_dict = yield dict(response3=http_client.fetch(url3),
                                   response4=http_client.fetch(url4))
        response3 = response_dict['response3']
        response4 = response_dict['response4']

If ``tornado.platform.twisted`` is imported, it is also possible to
yield Twisted's ``Deferred`` objects. See the `convert_yielded`
function to extend this mechanism.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   Dict support added.

.. versionchanged:: 4.1
   Support added for yielding ``asyncio`` Futures and Twisted Deferreds
   via ``singledispatch``.

    """Runs multiple asynchronous operations in parallel.

    ``children`` may either be a list or a dict whose values are
    yieldable objects. ``multi()`` returns a new yieldable
    object that resolves to a parallel structure containing their
    results. If ``children`` is a list, the result is a list of
    results in the same order; if it is a dict, the result is a dict
    with the same keys.

    That is, ``results = yield multi(list_of_futures)`` is equivalent
    to::

        results = []
        for future in list_of_futures:
            results.append(yield future)

    If any children raise exceptions, ``multi()`` will raise the first
    one. All others will be logged, unless they are of types
    contained in the ``quiet_exceptions`` argument.

    In a ``yield``-based coroutine, it is not normally necessary to
    call this function directly, since the coroutine runner will
    do it automatically when a list or dict is yielded. However,
    it is necessary in ``await``-based coroutines, or to pass
    the ``quiet_exceptions`` argument.

    This function is available under the names ``multi()`` and ``Multi()``
    for historical reasons.

    Cancelling a `.Future` returned by ``multi()`` does not cancel its
    children. `asyncio.gather` is similar to ``multi()``, but it does
    cancel its children.

    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       If multiple yieldables fail, any exceptions after the first
       (which is raised) will be logged. Added the ``quiet_exceptions``
