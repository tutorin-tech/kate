        slow path.  The fast path reads synchronously from socket
        buffers, while the slow path uses `_add_io_state` to schedule
        an IOLoop callback.

        To detect closed connections, we must have called

        much as possible so we don't have to set an `IOLoop.ERROR`
        listener that will be overwritten by the next slow-path
        operation. If a sequence of fast-path ops do not end in a
        slow-path op, (e.g. for an @asynchronous long-poll request),
        we must add the error handler.

class IOStream(BaseIOStream):
    r"""Socket-based `IOStream` implementation.

    This class supports the read and write methods from `BaseIOStream`
    plus a `connect` method.

    The ``socket`` parameter may either be connected or unconnected.
    For server operations the socket is the result of calling
    `socket.accept <socket.socket.accept>`.  For client operations the
    socket is created with `socket.socket`, and may either be
    connected before passing it to the `IOStream` or connected with
    `IOStream.connect`.
