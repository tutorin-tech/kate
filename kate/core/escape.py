"""Escaping/unescaping methods for HTML, JSON, URLs, and others.

Also includes a few other miscellaneous string manipulation functions that
have crept in over time.

Many functions in this module have near-equivalents in the standard library
(the differences mainly relate to handling of bytes and unicode strings,
and were more relevant in Python 2). In new code, the standard library
functions are encouraged instead of this module where applicable. See the
docstrings on each function for details.
